# Drug classification with Naive Bayes

## About the data
<p>The dataset was uploaded at Kaggle by Pratam Tripathi.</p>
<p>Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification">Drug Classification</a></p>
<p>Its perfect for this project because of its size, 200 rows. Small datasets and Naive Bayes are, usually, a good match.</p>

## The project
<p>First I imported the data and started to look for incosistent data, for that I did a quick EDA.</p>
<p>Then, using LabelEncoder, processed our categorical data and splited the dataset, 20% of it being the test data, so I save all of that in a pickle file.</p>
<p>Finnaly, the model was trained and evaluated, the classification report is at end of the drug-classification file.</p>
